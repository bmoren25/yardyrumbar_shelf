        producer: `<p>Rhum Barbancourt is Haiti's most famous rum distillery, founded in 1862 by Dupré Barbancourt. The distillery is located in the hills above Port-au-Prince and has been producing exceptional rhum agricole for over 150 years. Unlike most Caribbean rums made from molasses, Barbancourt uses pure sugarcane juice in the French agricole tradition.</p>
        <p>The Barbancourt family maintained control of the company for generations, surviving political upheaval, natural disasters, and economic challenges. Today, it remains one of Haiti's most important exports and a source of national pride.</p>`,
        aging: `<p>Barbancourt 4 Year is aged for a minimum of 4 years in Limousin oak barrels, the same type used for aging fine cognac. The aging takes place in Haiti's tropical climate, which accelerates maturation compared to temperate regions.</p>
        <p>The rum is double-distilled in copper pot stills using a method similar to cognac production, which gives Barbancourt its distinctive smooth character. After distillation, the rum is reduced to proof using natural spring water from the estate.</p>`,

        abv: "43%",
        age: "12 Years",
        type: "Pot & Column Still Blend",
        producer: `<p>Appleton Estate is Jamaica's oldest and most famous sugar estate and distillery, with a rum-making tradition dating back to 1749. Located in the Nassau Valley in the heart of Jamaica, the estate benefits from ideal conditions for rum production.</p>
        <p>The distillery uses both pot and column stills to create a diverse range of rums, which are then aged in oak barrels in the tropical climate, resulting in accelerated maturation and complex flavor profiles.</p>`,
        aging: `<p>Appleton Estate 12 Year is aged for a minimum of 12 years in used oak barrels. The aging takes place in Jamaica's tropical climate, where the "angel's share" can be up to 6% per year.</p>
        <p>This intense tropical aging accelerates the interaction between the rum and the wood, creating deeper flavors. The rum is a blend of pot and column still rums, carefully selected by the master blender.</p>`,
        appearance: "Deep amber with golden highlights",
        nose: "Rich aromas of oak, vanilla, and honey, with hints of orange peel and toasted almonds",
        palate: "Smooth and full-bodied with flavors of molasses, brown sugar, tropical fruit, and warm spices. Notes of coffee and cocoa emerge mid-palate.",
        finish: "Long and warming with lingering notes of oak and dried fruit",
